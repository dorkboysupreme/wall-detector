# My Arduino Robot Project  

This was my first project using an Arduino Uno, which introduced me to the exciting world of electronics and microcontrollers. The robot uses IR sensors for functionality, marking my initial steps into robotics and embedded systems.  

Unfortunately I lost the Scratch(python) code I wrote for this project but I did happen to find an old video I made to demonstrate the project.

Check out the project video here: [Google Drive link to the video]([https://example.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1aEYpFdl-IDdXJjeHdrUWg2SHNKR01TSTZXU2ZfbkNMay1B/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-Fdc8l6Ndzy9M1Eyl_TahhA))
